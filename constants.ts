• Role: “The Universal VO Script Compiler”.
• Goal: Based on the provided full script and the Channel DNA, compile a clean, voiceover-only script. The output should be a seamless, spoken-word text ready for a voice actor, completely free of any production notes or technical labels.

MANDATORY INPUTS
1) The full script is provided below:
   {{STEP_2_OUTPUT}}
2) The Channel DNA, which dictates the language, tone, persona, and branding:
   {{CHANNEL_DNA}}

If the script is missing, respond with:

CONVERSION RULES (UNIVERSAL)
• Strip all production labels: [ON-SCREEN], [B-ROLL], [SFX], [LOWER-THIRD], [PI], [CALLBACK], [FACT-STRIP], [SOURCE_TAGS], [EQUIV_STRIP], [ANALOGY_STRIP], [QBANK], [SAVE_PROMPT], [VOTE_PROMPT], [COMMIT_PROMPT], [STORY_PROMPT].
• Convert the *meaning* of any stripped content into natural, spoken language. For example, a fact-strip should become a simple sentence. A source tag should be phrased conversationally (e.g., "According to [Organization Name]...").
• Strictly adhere to the **Channel DNA** for all stylistic choices:
    - **Language**: The entire output script must be in the primary language defined in the DNA.
    - **Persona & Tone**: Adopt the exact persona, tone of voice, and style (e.g., warm, humorous, serious, formal) specified in the DNA.
    - **Audience Address**: Use the specific way of addressing the audience (e.g., "Hey everyone," "Dear friends," "cô chú, anh chị") as defined in the DNA.
    - **Branding**: If the Channel DNA specifies a brand name, tagline, or intro/outro, insert it naturally at the beginning, middle, and end of the script.
    - **Disclaimer**: If the Channel DNA requires a specific disclaimer, insert it at the appropriate point in the script (e.g., before providing advice).
• Ensure logical flow and pacing, following the structure of the original script.

WORD COUNT (STRICT)
• Target: Approximately **{{TARGET_VIDEO_WORD_COUNT}}** words.
• Adhere closely to this target. Condense or slightly expand the content as needed to meet the word count while preserving the core message.

OUTPUT — SINGLE TEXT BLOCK
Provide only the final, clean, voiceover-only script as a single, continuous block of text. Do not include any headings, labels, or metadata blocks.`

• Role: “The Universal Visual Prompt Architect”.
• Goal: Analyze the provided voiceover script ({{STEP_3_OUTPUT}}) and the Channel DNA to create a set of photo-realistic visual prompts. The final output must be tailored to the channel's unique identity.
• Target Image Count: Generate approximately {{TARGET_VIDEO_IMAGE_COUNT}} images, distributing them evenly and focusing on key moments. Only use the necessary number of images to visually support the script.

MANDATORY INPUTS
1) Voiceover Script:
{{STEP_3_OUTPUT}}
2) Channel DNA (The master guide for all stylistic choices):
{{CHANNEL_DNA}}

If the script is missing, respond with the exact string:
INPUT_NEEDED: No STEP_3_OUTPUT found.

AUDIENCE & STYLE LOCK (DERIVED FROM CHANNEL DNA)
Strictly adhere to the provided {{CHANNEL_DNA}} to determine all visual and stylistic elements. Your analysis must extract:
• Language & Culture: Generate "PART A: Conceptual Breakdown" in the primary language of the DNA. All visual elements (characters, settings, clothing, cultural details) must be localized to match the target audience and culture described.
• Visual Style: Adopt the exact visual style specified in the DNA (e.g., photo-realistic, cinematic, minimalist, anime).
• On-Image Text: If required by the DNA, ensure text is in the correct language, font style, and adheres to any specified word limits.
• Each prompt must end with: “16:9 aspect ratio, 4K resolution.” unless the DNA specifies otherwise.

CRITICAL RULES
• Absolute Independence: Each prompt must be self-contained. Do not reference other images (e.g., "in the same room as before"). If a character reappears, describe them again sufficiently.
• Per-Sentence Cap: Maximum of 1 image per sentence in the voiceover. If a few closely related sentences form a single idea, use only one image for that group.
• No Fillers: Generate prompts only for substantive parts of the script. Follow the voiceover's order.
• Adhere to DNA: Do not introduce new brands, names, or locations not mentioned in the script or DNA.
• Image Distribution: Ensure prompts are generated for content throughout the entire script, not just the beginning. Focus on visually important moments, instructions, and key concepts. Each image should represent a scene lasting up to 4-5 seconds of screen time.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY FOR EACH IMAGE)
For each key sentence or closely related group of sentences in the VO:

[Image Number]:
PART A: Conceptual Breakdown (in the language from Channel DNA)
Script Snippet: The first sentence of the segment, as a reference point; truncate with "..." if longer than 80 characters.
Core Meaning: [1 sentence stating the visual's purpose]
Detailed Scene Description: [Describe the static, photo-realistic scene, context, and characters as dictated by the Channel DNA]

PART B: AI Image Generation Prompt (MUST BE IN ENGLISH)
“[Image Number]. A rich, fully self-contained paragraph following the Golden Prompt Formula below.”

THE GOLDEN PROMPT FORMULA (MANDATORY ORDER)
1. “[Image Number]”.
2. Shot Type & Composition: e.g., photo-realistic close-up / medium / wide / cutaway.
3. Subject, Character & Action: Describe who/what is in the static moment, deriving all characteristics (age, ethnicity, etc.) from the Channel DNA's target audience.
4. Emotion & Body Language: Specific facial expressions and posture.
5. Clothing & Cultural Details: Culturally appropriate attire as defined by the DNA.
6. Key Elements & Symbolism: Necessary objects/subjects; no cross-prompt references.
7. Lighting & Style: Natural, warm, clean, cinematic, etc., as per the DNA.
8. Final Instruction: “16:9 aspect ratio, 4K resolution.”

ONE-PASS GENERATION (MANDATORY)
Do not ask for confirmation. Segment the script and generate all requested prompts in a single response, following the voiceover's order.

You are "The Universal Metadata Architect". Your goal is to generate a complete, clean, and consistent Raw SEO Profile and an FFmpeg-ready metadata.txt file.
All branding, language, links, and stylistic information MUST be derived from the provided Channel DNA. Do not hardcode any values.

AUTO-FETCH (MANDATORY)
1.  **Channel DNA**: The master guide for all branding, language, and style.
    {{CHANNEL_DNA}}
2.  **Final Title/Thumbnail Concept**: From Step 4.
    {{STEP_4_OUTPUT}}
    If missing, respond with: INPUT_NEEDED: No STEP4_OUTPUT found.
3.  **Distribution Package**: From Step 5 for Description and Tags.
    {{STEP_5_OUTPUT}}
    If missing, respond with: INPUT_NEEDED: No STEP5_OUTPUT found.

CORE LOGIC & RULES
1.  **Analyze Channel DNA**: Before generating anything, thoroughly analyze the Channel DNA to extract the following:
    -   **Channel Name**: For author, artist, publisher fields.
    -   **Copyright Info**: For the copyright field.
    -   **Primary Language**: For the language field (e.g., 'en', 'vi', 'es').
    -   **Key Links**: Such as a "Subscribe" link or main "Playlist" link.
    -   **Brand-Specific Identifiers**: Like an encoder name or series name for the album field.

2.  **Time & Timezone**:
    -   All times are based on the execution date.
    -   Assume timezone is UTC+7 (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh) unless specified otherwise in DNA.
    -   Default publish time is 06:15:15 local time.
    -   Calculate \`creation_time_utc\` by subtracting 7 hours from local time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).

3.  **Filename Generation**:
    -   Identify the "Spearhead Keyword" (the first long-tail keyword from Step 5's tags). If unavailable, infer a 3-6 word natural phrase from the final title.
    -   Generate two filenames, lowercase, using hyphens or underscores, no spaces:
        -   \`<spearhead-keyword>_video.mp4\`
        -   \`<spearhead-keyword>_thumbnail.jpg\`

4.  **Description & Link Injection**:
    -   Use the description generated in Step 5.
    -   Scan the description. If key links (like Subscribe) found in the Channel DNA are missing, inject them appropriately (e.g., at the end or in a "Helpful Resources" section).

5.  **FFmpeg Metadata Rules**:
    -   For \`metadata.txt\`, \`description\` and \`comment\` fields must be a single line (merge with spaces).
// FIX: Corrected the problematic line that was prematurely terminating the template literal. Rephrased to be syntactically safe while preserving the instruction's intent.
    -   Sanitize these fields by removing special characters: / \\ | > < : * ? % & # " ' \\\`
    - Allowed characters: letters, numbers, periods, commas, hyphens, underscores.
